# Tea Order App
A very basic app that allows a user to order a tea. It demonstrates the use of `nested scopes/closures.` An instance, `newOrder`, of the function `orderTea()` is generated. `OrderTea()` registers a tea order and than calls it's inner function within it's scope `makeTea()` which subsequently makes the tea and confirms this via `react hooks`. 

## Technologies
This is using React, Webpack, Reactstrap, and SASS.

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```
